## The True Value of Coding Standards
Coding standards are typically viewed as minor, nitpicky specifications about indentation, bracket placement, and a host of other items. The true value in a coding standard comes from the consistency it provides to a codebase and when working in teams. This harmony improves readability, collaboration, and maintainability as developers can fix bugs rather than learn a myriad of ways of coding. More importantly, coding standards often contain best practices regarding security, performance, and modularity that will keep your code clean but also robust.

## Learning Through ESLint with VSCode and TypeScript
These coding standards, enforced through tools like ESLint in VSCode, especially when using TypeScript, act almost as a guidebook to 'what not to do'. ESLint gives feedback in real-time on potential errors and syntax issues, as well as best practices. Though it is frustrating at first-having to correct each little mistake feels torturous-the immediacy of the feedback loop helps developers learn some of the fine points of TypeScript and common pitfalls. This process, over time, becomes one of internalizing good habits that improve quality naturally.

## Balancing Rigidity and Flexibility
While coding standards are important in maintaining quality, especially with the use of ESLint to enforce them, it is equally important not to be too inflexible as this tends to mute creativity. Sometimes, developers feel that some of these rules don't quite fit the problem they're trying to solve. It really is a matter of balance: Coding standards are important in encouraging best practices, yet also need to allow room for flexibility when needed. In taking this approach, code will remain clean, maintainable code while allowing innovation and problem-solving to still occur.
